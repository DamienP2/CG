//! Thread priorities for the playout. The channel clock, the render threads
//! and the output threads ask the system to run them ahead of ordinary work:
//! a clock tick or a frame that waits behind a backup, a browser or a
//! compile is a frame shown twice on air.
//!
//! - macOS: the "user interactive" class (no timer coalescing, performance
//!   cores), the class of the frontmost app's interface.
//! - Linux: the clock gets a real-time slot when the service may have one
//!   (root, CAP_SYS_NICE); the others keep the service's raised priority.
//! - Windows: higher thread priorities (time-critical for the clock).

/// What a thread does.
